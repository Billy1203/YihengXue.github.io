# Resume


I have graduated from SUSTech in July, 2019. My major is CSE and I am interesting on Computer Vision and Machine Learning. Experience a four-year English learning environment and learn new things quickly. I have studied *Financial Accounting*, *Internet of Finance* and some other Fin-tech courses. 

My capstone design is *Real-time 3D human skeleton reconstruction based on camera array system* which is the No.2 project design @College of Engineering of SUSTech. I have focused on this project during my last year in SUSTech. I hope to do some related works about *Computer Vision* & *Machine Learning*.

I chose to have a gap year began on July, 2019. I am a teach assistant of Machine Learning & Intelligent Robots courses in SUSTech and I am also doing some other research projects.
